### Idea
In the next workshop about Amazon Translate, we will learn and practice **customize your translations**.

Also refer to this architecture to improve **serverless translation**.

Additionally, we can combine with **Amazon Polly** to convert text-to-speech.

Those are ideas for the next workshop about amazon translate.
