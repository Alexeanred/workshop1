# TRANSLATE AWS BLOGS FASTER WITH AMAZON TRANSLATE

### Overview
In this lab, you will learn how to use Amazon Translate by practicing two methods to translate text from English to Vietnamese.

 1. The first method is batch translation:
 - The advantage is that it is easy to set up, the disadvantage is that the translation waiting time is quite long.

 2. The second method is serverless translation:
 - The advantage is that the translation time is fast, almost real time, the disadvantage is that the setup is more difficult.
